# **Car Solution Army**

**[CSA](https://pp5-react-3a1a7789b87e.herokuapp.com/)** was developed and submitted as the fifth and final Portfolio Project as part of the Advanced Frontend specialization for Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development.

# **Car Solution Army**

This project marks the introduction of a diverse range of features and functionalities designed to enrich the experience of users passionate about DIY car maintenance, inspired by my previous work with similar blogs, sites and tutorials. CSA is a virtual hub tailored for a vibrant community of DIY car enthusiasts, specifically those dedicated to resolving issues and sharing knowledge about various car models and repair techniques.

In contrast to its earlier iterations, this platform now offers a more immersive and interactive experience, aiming to serve as the ultimate social media platform exclusively crafted for individuals interested in DIY car repairs. It stands as a unique offering, as it appears to be the sole online space dedicated to empowering DIY car enthusiasts to collaborate and learn from one another's experiences.

The platform not only fulfills the existing demand for learning and interactive engagement among those passionate about DIY car maintenance but also strives to amplify that demand. It serves as a rare opportunity for users to establish and nurture their very own distinct online community. Here, members are encouraged to share their challenges, seek solutions, and collaboratively troubleshoot a myriad of car-related problems. The platform thrives on the spirit of camaraderie, where DIY enthusiasts unite to enhance their skills and contribute to a thriving community of car fixers.

  ### Agile Project Planning Process:

#### 1. **Project Vision and Scope:**

- Define the project vision, objectives, and scope.
- Identify key stakeholders and gather their input.

#### 2. **Create a Product Backlog:**

- Develop a prioritized list of features, enhancements, and tasks.
- Prioritize items based on business value, customer needs, and dependencies.

#### 3. **Sprint Planning:**

- **Backlog Refinement:**
  - Review and refine the items in the product backlog.
  - Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable user stories.
- **Sprint Planning Meeting:**
  - Select a subset of high-priority items from the product backlog for the upcoming sprint.
  - Define the sprint goal and success criteria.
  - Team collaboratively estimates the effort required for each user story (using story points or other estimation techniques).
  - Commit to the sprint backlog (items to be completed during the sprint).

#### 4. **Sprint Execution:**

- **Daily Stand-up Meetings:**
  - Team members share progress, challenges, and plans for the day.
  - Discuss impediments and work together to resolve them.
- **Development and Testing:**
  - Developers work on implementing user stories.
  - Testers perform continuous testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests.
  - Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices if applicable.
- **Collaboration and Communication:**
  - Regular communication within the team and with stakeholders.
  - Foster a collaborative environment to encourage problem-solving and knowledge sharing.

#### 5. **Incremental Development:**

- Deliver incremental, potentially shippable product increments at the end of each sprint.
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and end-users after each sprint review.
- Iterate and make necessary adjustments based on feedback received.

#### 6. **Sprint Review and Retrospective:**

- **Sprint Review:**
  - Demo the completed user stories to stakeholders.
  - Collect feedback and review the sprint goals.
- **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - Reflect on the sprint process and team dynamics.
  - Identify what went well and areas for improvement.
  - Discuss actionable items to enhance team performance in the next sprint.

#### 7. **Repeat:**

- Conduct subsequent sprints, each typically lasting 1-4 weeks.
- Continuously refine the product backlog based on changing priorities and customer feedback.
- Adapt plans and strategies based on lessons learned from previous sprints.

#### 8. **Release Planning (Optional):**

- Plan releases based on the completed increments and overall project goals.
- Determine release dates, feature sets, and any necessary preparations for deployment.

#### 9. **Monitoring and Metrics:**

- Track key metrics such as velocity, sprint burndown, and customer satisfaction.
- Use metrics to analyze team performance and project progress.
- Make data-driven decisions to optimize the team's workflow and delivery process.

#### 10. **Continuous Improvement:**

To provide real-time feedback to users notifying them of any changes they make to their data I used React's ['NotificationContainer' component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-notifications).
